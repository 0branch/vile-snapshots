: m4 actually uses '`' and '\'' characters by default for quoting.  However, I
: use it mostly as part of autoconf, where the quoting is changed to square
: brackets to make it simpler to use with Bourne shell scripts.  Comment these
: out, or customize as needed -- the filter does not do the library file
: searches that are required to do this exactly right.
.class LeftQuote:'['
.class RightQuote:']'

: These are the keywords recognized by GNU m4.  A few are actually only
: recognized when they are followed by parameters in parentheses, but that's
: too specialized.
