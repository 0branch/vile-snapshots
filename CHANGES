Changes for vile 8.1 (released ??? ??? ??, 1998)

 (tom) 980703 (c)
 	+ remove spurious 'void' in perl.xs which caused items to be miscounted
	  (report by Kuntal M. Daftary, patch by Kevin Buettner).
	+ shorten identifiers to no more than 31 characters (reported by
	  Graeme Miller).
	> patches by Clark Morgan:
	+ fix for a problem reported by Paul Fox:  when a dos box has scroll
	  bars (window size smaller than buffer size), then :!<dir> displays
	  its output in a switched screen context that the user can't examine. 
	  This applies to console vile only (winvile has much worse problems in
	  the same scenario :-).
	+ changes to make -!  use the same code path as filter-region and
	  read-pipe when the host is win32-based.
	+ implement paste-from-clipboard for win32, bound to Shift+Insert
	+ add a new documentation file (doc/w32modes.doc) that describes the
	  optimum settings for win32 modes when the host OS is not NT4.

 (tom) 980702 (b)
	+ change highlighting rule in vile-c-filt to highlight only the
	  "#" and keyword on preprocessor lines (patch by Paul Fox).
	+ dynamically allocate pm_buffer array in menu.c, eliminating limit on
	  number of menu items (reported by William Yuan
	  <yuan@bucket.its.unimelb.edu.au>).
 	+ new configure macro CF_CC_INIT_UNIONS checks for compilers that
	  cannot initialize a union, e.g, a K&R compiler using unproto.
	  Ifdef'd union in CMDFUNC to work in that case.
	+ correct spelling of EXTRA_LOAD_FLAGS in CF_IMAKE_CFLAGS configure
	  macro.
	+ set VIEWOK flag on stored-procedure buffers, otherwise they cannot
	  be used in buffers set "view" (reported by Larry Gensch).
	+ rename character-type names to use "vl" prefix, to avoid conflict
	  with ctype.h names on Digital Unix 5.0 (patch by Larry Gensch).
	+ note that $progname may be "winvile" (patch by Clark Morgan).
	+ modify configure.in and makefile.in so that $(datadir)/perl is not
	  created unless vile is configured --with-perl (patch by Brendan
	  O'Dea).
	+ require perl 5.004 since the XS interface is dependent upon tied file
	  handles, which are not completely implemented in 5.003 (request by
	  Brendan O'Dea).

 (kev) 980606 (a)
 	+ perl.xs (svrs): No longer a global static variable.
	  (perl_init): Don't initialize svrs here anymore.  Also, stifle
	  compiler warning.
	  (READLINE): Declare and initialize svrs here, but only for
	  platforms on which it's broken.
	  (perl_default_region, do_perl_cmd, set_region): Adjust r_size
	  field in region returned by getregion to account for buffers
	  which don't have a trailing newline.
	  (newVBrv): call gv_IOadd() in order to be able to use $. with
	  the filehandles.
	  (newVBrv, do_perl_cmd, set_region): Initialize $. .
	  (READLINE): increment (or advance) $. as appropriate.

	  [Brendan O'Dea sent me patches for much of the above.]
