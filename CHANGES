Changes for vile 6.2 (released ??? ??? ??, 1996)

(tom)	961006 (d)
	+ correct filling of blanks for non-bce terminals, so the filling is
	  used only for color terminals (tcap.c).

(kev)	961004 (c)
	+ x11.c (update_scrollbar_sizes):  Make sure that grips are
	  managed properly when multiple windows are created at
	  startup.  Fixes David Snyder's "xvile -h" bug where it was
	  not possible to resize the two windows by grabbing the
	  resize grips.

(tom)	961004 (b)
	+ rename 'refresh()' to 'vile_refresh()', 'filter()' to 'vile_filter()',
	  to avoid naming-conflict when including <curses.h> to support terminfo
	  driver.
	+ correct missing assignment for scanpt from 6.1a (exec.c).
	+ correct sign-extension problem in setup_dobuf() from 6.1a (exec.c)
	+ added (write-only!) $cryptkey variable (eval.c).
	+ don't attempt to set encryption on temporary buffers unless global
	  'crypt' mode is set (buffer.c).
	+ correct logic that reset local 'crypt' mode w/o restoring it, preventing
	  user from reading encrypted files (file.c)
	+ modify so that OPT_CRYPT and OPT_WORDCOUNT are normally configured.
	+ modify termcap driver to conditionally compile for terminfo libraries
	  so that if vile is built on a system such as Solaris that provides
	  termcap compatibility via terminfo, the color support will work.
	+ modify configure script to check for terminfo libraries.
	+ modify termcap driver so that if "op" (original pair) is defined,
	  fcolor and bcolor default to "default", for better compatibilty
	  with color_xterm and dtterm (tcap.c).
	+ modify termcap driver to use "ut" capability to denote whether
	  background-color-erase (bce) is supported (tcap.c).

(tom)	960920 (a)
	+ allow continuation-lines in macros, denoted by a backslash at the
	  end of the line.
	+ add new directive "~elseif" (exec.c)
	+ restructured dobuf() using new function 'begin_directive()', fixing a
	  place where 'execstr' was modified w/o saving old value (exec.c)
	+ add new function 'no_such_function()' (bind.c, etc.)
	+ modified debug-trace in msg_putc() to work around Linux's printf
	  which calls strlen on all string arguments (msgs.c).
	+ modified to not use "#elif", since HP/UX K&R compiler doesn't handle
	  this (termio.c).

Changes for vile 6.1 (released Tue Sep 10, 1996)

(pgf)	960910
	+ added text to README and vile.hlp regarding possibility of
	  tom's taking over the source tree.  not completely firmed
	  up yet, but likely.  thanks tom!!!!

(tom)	960903 (d)
	+ adapted patch by Larry Schwimmer's (schwim@cyclone.stanford.edu)
	  for configure.in

	+ modify configure script to ensure that cached information is used
	  only on the system/version that was used to extract the data.

	+ remove (and correct rules for generating) vms_link.opt, vmsshare.opt

(pgf)	960812 (c)
	+ removed const from dirnam[] buffer in imdying.  removed cast
	  to (char *) which prevented any compiler in the world from
	  showing us this error.  grrr.  i hope no one else loses
	  work because of this one.  (file.c)

	+ fix minor warning from extern'd prototype in buffer.c.

	+ removed vile.man production rule from makefile.in.

	+ applied changes from martin zinser (m.zinser@gsi.de) for VMS
	  builds -- mostly casts, and some changes to the vms build scripts.

(jrs)	960809 (b)
	+ on NT reset the console input mode after a shell escape to fix
	  the problem reported by paul with ^C.  (ntconio.c)

	+ fixed a file corrupting bug caused by reading in a <CR><LF> file
	  which contained lines longer than 255 characters by accounting
	  for the possible fall-through of fastreadf into slowreadf in that
	  case.  (file.c)

	+ don't reset the keyboard when simply writing a file since it
	  causes an annoying screen flash with the new NT screen buffer
	  handling.  (file.c)

	+ some minor changes to prevent us accessing (not even dereferencing)
	  dangling pointers.  (buffer.c, file.c, itbuff.c, tbuff.c, path.c,
	  search.c)

	+ fix leak of the minibuffer window structure.  (window.c) 

	+ make sure ttgetc returns something on all platforms, even if
	  it isn't used.  (termio.c)

	+ make nthandler return a value (in case it ever gets called :-).
	  (ntconio.c)

(pgf)	960717 (a)
	+ applied rick's changes for proper operation in an NT command
	  window with scrollbars.  (ntconio.c)

	+ add target for formatting the man page, so a readable version
	  can go in the pc zip distributions.  (makefile.in)

	+ don't run the readhook for is_temporary() buffers.  (file.c)

	+ fix usage message. (version.c)
