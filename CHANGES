Changes for vile 6.4 (released ??? ??? ??, 1996)

(tom)	961216 (c)
	+ correction to infinite-loop fix in 6.3b
	+ add $helpfile symbol, initialized to "vile.hlp".

(tom)	961208 (b)
	+ added "print-prefixed-lines-til" command to print into [p-lines]
	  while prefixing the lines with filename and line-number.
	+ work-around Linux bug that causes 'getchar()' to return incorrect
	  value after an interrupt, so inserts of ^C would be garbled (input.c).
	+ guard against infinite loop which resulted from reverse search on
	  "$", resulting from 6.2a fixes (search.c).
	+ implement colored attributes in termcap driver (tcap.c)
	+ correct typo in cache-variable for VC_TYPE_OUTCHAR macro
	+ test with autoconf 2.12 (no change needed).

(tom)	961122 (a)
	+ modify handling of xterm mouse-click in insert mode to allow it
	  unless the click would move the cursor out of the current window
	  (requested by David McCoy).

Changes for vile 6.3 (released Mon Nov 18, 1996)

(tom)	961117 (g)
	+ moved xvile's translation strings out of fallback resources, since
	  these are ignored when a resource file is installed (e.g., in
	  $HOME/XVile or /usr/lib/X11/app-defaults/XVile), causing the
	  scrollbars to become unworkable.
	+ use 'newprocessgroup()' rather than 'fork()' for xvile -fork.
	+ correct threshold in updpos() so that when list mode is set, a ^J
	  in the last screen column (e.g., 80) will be visible.
	+ correct limits for whitespace-removal in 'inspound()' that caused
	  lines to join when inserting a '#' after typing ^D in an open-line
	  command (reported by Emil Rojas).
	+ modify so that '~' is not escaped when echoing previous value for a
	  string unless it was used in the special case of string replacement. 

(tom)	961113 (f)
	+ clarified special-character expansion in vile.hlp (Paul Fox).
	+ add alias to xvile for "-t" option to prevent it from superceding the
	  normal vile "-t" option (x11.c).
	+ added resources for xvile pointer shapes (x11.c) requested by Tim Su
	  <tsu@garage.lucent.com>.
	+ added -fork command-line option to xvile, to fork process after
	  initialization (main.c, version.c, x11.c) requested by Richard
	  Mitchell <mitchell@osb1.wff.nasa.gov>.
	+ added error handler so that xvile prints usage message if command
	  line parsing or Xt initialization fails (x11.c).
	+ add ifdef to file.c to accommodate missing extern for 'environ' in
	  djgpp 2.x (patch by Jerry Alexandratos).

(tom)	961107 (e)
	+ correct symbol conflict with shared library on OpenVMS 7.0 by
	  renaming opendir, etc., and tempnam.  Also, remove redundant rule for
	  vms_link.opt from descrip.mms (from logs by Sheldon E. Smith
	  <ssmith@galina.ENET.dec.com>).
	+ correct sign-extension in ntconio.c that prevented display of 8-bit
	  characters (fix by Even Holen <evenh@pvv.ntnu.no>).
	+ fix compiler warnings in borland.c (from logs by Jerry Alexandratos
	  <alexandr@hawk.pearson.udel.edu>).
	+ correction to logic for "~endif", macros weren't re-enabled after
	  exiting an ~if/~endif (fix by Ian Jamison <ianj@quadrics.com>).

(tom)	961105 (d)
	+ apply Brendan O'Dea's <bod@tyndall.com.au> followup patch to ensure
	  that "#", "%" and ":" substitions aren't made in search/replacement
	  inputs.

(pgf)	961030 (c)
	+ apply brendan o'dea's patch to implement use of ~ in a replacement
	  pattern, to expand to the previous replacement.  this patch also
	  turns off the longstanding behavior of supplying the previous
	  replacement pattern as the default response to the "replacement
	  string: "  prompt.  i added a paragraph in the help file.  (estruct.h
	  input.c main.c oneliner.c search.c)

(tom)	961022 (b)
	+ modify 'showpat()' to show at least one highlighted space even if the
	  pattern is null, e.g., a '$' matching the end of line (oneliner.c).
	+ implement $forward-search variable (modetbl, eval.c).
	+ corrected "^$" pattern-matching broken in 6.2a (search.c).

(tom)	961019 (a)
	+ corrected logic of ~else/~elseif broken in 6.1a (exec.c), reported by
	  Timothy Phan <tphan@asl.dl.nec.com>.
	+ use new type IFSTK to combine if-stacking variables to clarify their
	  relationship (exec.c).
	+ modified macro trace to make if simpler to understand (exec.c).
	+ corrected boundary condition that prevented match of "\>" on the end
	  of line in search commands (search.c).
	+ corrected handling of command line arguments with similar buffer
	  names by prohibiting match against buffer names (main.c, file.c).
	+ corrected translation of '\\' in special case where it preceded a
	  potential metachar, causing search for "\\>" to fail (regexp.c),
	  reported by Emil Rojas.
	+ corrected wrap-around case in tags lookup where there was only one
	  match; using next-tag would report that there was no such tag
	  (tags.c).
	+ implement regular-expressions in cheap_buffer_scan(), making it work
	  with trailing "\>" emitted by ctags -N option (tags.c) reported by
	  Emil Rojas <erojas@divi.com>.
	+ add double-checks in swbuffer() and related logic to recover in case
	  $buffer-hook frees the current buffer (buffer.c), reported by
	  Sean Ahern <ahern@sphere.llnl.gov>.

Changes for vile 6.2 (released Tue Oct 15, 1996)

(tom)	961006 (d)
	+ correct filling of blanks for non-bce terminals, so the filling is
	  used only for color terminals (tcap.c).

(kev)	961004 (c)
	+ x11.c (update_scrollbar_sizes):  Make sure that grips are
	  managed properly when multiple windows are created at
	  startup.  Fixes David Snyder's "xvile -h" bug where it was
	  not possible to resize the two windows by grabbing the
	  resize grips.

(tom)	961004 (b)
	+ rename 'refresh()' to 'vile_refresh()', 'filter()' to 'vile_filter()',
	  to avoid naming-conflict when including <curses.h> to support terminfo
	  driver.
	+ correct missing assignment for scanpt from 6.1a (exec.c).
	+ correct sign-extension problem in setup_dobuf() from 6.1a (exec.c)
	+ added (write-only!) $cryptkey variable (eval.c).
	+ don't attempt to set encryption on temporary buffers unless global
	  'crypt' mode is set (buffer.c).
	+ correct logic that reset local 'crypt' mode w/o restoring it, preventing
	  user from reading encrypted files (file.c)
	+ modify so that OPT_CRYPT and OPT_WORDCOUNT are normally configured.
	+ modify termcap driver to conditionally compile for terminfo libraries
	  so that if vile is built on a system such as Solaris that provides
	  termcap compatibility via terminfo, the color support will work.
	+ modify configure script to check for terminfo libraries.
	+ modify termcap driver so that if "op" (original pair) is defined,
	  fcolor and bcolor default to "default", for better compatibilty
	  with color_xterm and dtterm (tcap.c).
	+ modify termcap driver to use "ut" capability to denote whether
	  background-color-erase (bce) is supported (tcap.c).

(tom)	960920 (a)
	+ allow continuation-lines in macros, denoted by a backslash at the
	  end of the line.
	+ add new directive "~elseif" (exec.c)
	+ restructured dobuf() using new function 'begin_directive()', fixing a
	  place where 'execstr' was modified w/o saving old value (exec.c)
	+ add new function 'no_such_function()' (bind.c, etc.)
	+ modified debug-trace in msg_putc() to work around Linux's printf
	  which calls strlen on all string arguments (msgs.c).
	+ modified to not use "#elif", since HP/UX K&R compiler doesn't handle
	  this (termio.c).

Changes for vile 6.1 (released Tue Sep 10, 1996)

(pgf)	960910
	+ added text to README and vile.hlp regarding possibility of
	  tom's taking over the source tree.  not completely firmed
	  up yet, but likely.  thanks tom!!!!

(tom)	960903 (d)
	+ adapted patch by Larry Schwimmer's (schwim@cyclone.stanford.edu)
	  for configure.in

	+ modify configure script to ensure that cached information is used
	  only on the system/version that was used to extract the data.

	+ remove (and correct rules for generating) vms_link.opt, vmsshare.opt

(pgf)	960812 (c)
	+ removed const from dirnam[] buffer in imdying.  removed cast
	  to (char *) which prevented any compiler in the world from
	  showing us this error.  grrr.  i hope no one else loses
	  work because of this one.  (file.c)

	+ fix minor warning from extern'd prototype in buffer.c.

	+ removed vile.man production rule from makefile.in.

	+ applied changes from martin zinser (m.zinser@gsi.de) for VMS
	  builds -- mostly casts, and some changes to the vms build scripts.

(jrs)	960809 (b)
	+ on NT reset the console input mode after a shell escape to fix
	  the problem reported by paul with ^C.  (ntconio.c)

	+ fixed a file corrupting bug caused by reading in a <CR><LF> file
	  which contained lines longer than 255 characters by accounting
	  for the possible fall-through of fastreadf into slowreadf in that
	  case.  (file.c)

	+ don't reset the keyboard when simply writing a file since it
	  causes an annoying screen flash with the new NT screen buffer
	  handling.  (file.c)

	+ some minor changes to prevent us accessing (not even dereferencing)
	  dangling pointers.  (buffer.c, file.c, itbuff.c, tbuff.c, path.c,
	  search.c)

	+ fix leak of the minibuffer window structure.  (window.c) 

	+ make sure ttgetc returns something on all platforms, even if
	  it isn't used.  (termio.c)

	+ make nthandler return a value (in case it ever gets called :-).
	  (ntconio.c)

(pgf)	960717 (a)
	+ applied rick's changes for proper operation in an NT command
	  window with scrollbars.  (ntconio.c)

	+ add target for formatting the man page, so a readable version
	  can go in the pc zip distributions.  (makefile.in)

	+ don't run the readhook for is_temporary() buffers.  (file.c)

	+ fix usage message. (version.c)
