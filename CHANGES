Changes for vile 6.1 (released ???)

(jrs)	960809 (b)

	+ on NT reset the console input mode after a shell escape to fix
	  the problem reported by paul with ^C.  (ntconio.c)

	+ fixed a file corrupting bug caused by reading in a <CR><LF> file
	  which contained lines longer than 255 characters by accounting
	  for the possible fall-through of fastreadf into slowreadf in that
	  case.  (file.c)

	+ don't reset the keyboard when simply writing a file since it
	  causes an annoying screen flash with the new NT screen buffer
	  handling.  (file.c)

	+ some minor changes to prevent us accessing (not even dereferencing)
	  dangling pointers.  (buffer.c, file.c, itbuff.c, tbuff.c, path.c,
	  search.c)

	+ fix leak of the minibuffer window structure.  (window.c) 

	+ make sure ttgetc returns something on all platforms, even if
	  it isn't used.  (termio.c)

	+ make nthandler return a value (in case it ever gets called :-).
	  (ntconio.c)

(pgf)	960717 (a)

	+ applied rick's changes for proper operation in an NT command
	  window with scrollbars.  (ntconio.c)

	+ add target for formatting the man page, so a readable version
	  can go in the pc zip distributions.  (makefile.in)

	+ don't run the readhook for is_temporary() buffers.  (file.c)

	+ fix usage message. (version.c)
