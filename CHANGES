Changes for vile 9.1 (released ??? ??? ??, 1999)

 (tom) 991127 (b)
 	+ add "case" and "do" groups to m4mode.
 	+ add ".ms" and ".me" suffixes for nrmode.
	+ add ``quote'' quoting to txt filter.
	+ refine treatment of double-quote in txt filter so it can be quoted
	  by single-quote or parenthesis.
	+ allow "~" in URL patterns for txt and mail filters, omitted in 9.0a.
 	+ correct some missing backslashes before vertical bar and parentheses
	  in filters.rc, made apparent by the change to use single-quoted
	  strings.
	+ restore handling of special control characters such as ^D, ^T in
	  insert mode which happened to be GOAL or MOTION commands (reported by
	  Clark Morgan).

 (tom) 991124 (a)
	+ add single-quoted strings, which eliminate the need for escaping
	  backslash (suggested by Paul Fox).
	+ modify logic in ins_any_time() to interpret control characters which
	  are bound to GOAL or MOTION commands rather than inserting them
	  without quoting.  This allows ^E and ^Y as commands within an insert
	  (request by Quang Ngo <quang@usa.net>).
	+ change several commands to use GOAL flag, which tells vile that they
	  may move to a new line, but try to keep the column constant.  Doing
	  this has the side-effect that they are usable in quoted-motion:
	  grow-window, move-next-window-down, move-next-window-up,
	  position-window (z), redraw-display, scroll-next-window-down,
	  scroll-next-window-up and shrink-window, as well as api_motion().
 	+ modify quoted-motion so that commands with the GOAL flag are allowed,
	  since those do not change the buffer contents.
	+ change handling of status return from readpattern() so that an abort
	  is passed up to the caller.  In execute-named-procedure, check for
	  abort, and restore DOT to the value before evaluating addresses
	  (reported by Clark Morgan).
 	+ correct bug in wrapmargin/fillcol logic which did not split a line
	  when a newline was inserted into a string containing no blanks
	  after the fillcol position.  Instead, an empty line was inserted
	  (reported by Clark Morgan).
 	+ correct missing allocation of default help-string for user-defined
	  procedures, which could cause core dump if a procedure were redefined,
	  e.g., by source'ing .vilerc (reported by Paul Fox).
 	+ add tags syntax filter and majormode tagsmode.
	+ add X resource syntax filter and majormode xresmode.
	+ improve URL pattern in mail and txt filters, to allow it to match
	  ftp and other URL types, as well as limited the pattern to avoid
	  picking up things like trailing '>' characters.
	+ correct some syntax filters' expressions for REAL, which were
	  expecting two digits after the decimal point, rather one.
	> patches by Clark Morgan:
	+ enable "kill-buffer <wildcard-expr>" on VMS.
	+ fix to allow accessing multiple versions of DECNET-based files.
	  That is, this now works:
		$ vile node::dir:log.txt;*       <- open all copies of log.txt
	+ eliminate stray cursor glyphs in the message buffer (most often
	  happens when a Win32 dialog is dismissed at the "same time" that a
	  winvile command writes status text).

This change log started on Friday Nov 19, 1999.
