Changes for vile 7.1 (released ??? ??? ??, 1997)

(tom)	970330 (d)
	+ correct missing ']' on generated buffer name for shell output, e.g.,
	  "[!ls]" rather than "[!ls" (reported by Paul Fox): (file.c).
	+ correct unnecessary escaping of '!' in prompts that are not expanding
	  the shell contents (reported by Paul Fox): (input.c).
	+ modify semaphore used by 'working' mode to make the SIGALRM timer
	  elapse when it is not in use, allowing idle process to swap out
	  properly (reported by Bill Kipp): (display.c, etc).
	+ correct filename parsing for MS-DOS/etc configuration by checking
	  for device name (patch by Clark Morgan).

(tom)	970322 (c)
	+ fixes for piping to vile in WinNT (patch by Clark Morgan).
	+ add logic for visual-matches in color, WinNT (patch by Clark Morgan).
	+ add vile-c-filt.exe to makefile.wnt, modify default keyword file
	  on that system to vile.keywords (patch by Clark Morgan).
	+ correct problem with MS-DOS/Win95/NT version of npopen.c that left
	  temp-files after reading from pipe, because file-remove was done
	  before closing (patch by Clark Morgan).

(tom)	970315 (b)
	+ use macro GCC_UNUSED throughout to quiet gcc warnings about unused
	  (dummy) parameters.
	+ modify configure script to use VC_GCC_WARNINGS
	+ add mode to control whether formatting adds one or two spaces
	  after sentences (patch by Otto Lind).
	+ handle C++ comments (patch by Otto Lind <otto.lind@softwire.com>).
	+ implement colored attributes in OS/2 video driver (os2vio.c)
	+ modify writereg() so that it recomputes the region size after
	  invoking the $write-hook; this is necessary since it may change the
	  file's size (reported by Bob Wall <wall@vlt.com>).

(tom)	970314 (a)
	+ modify c-filt.c, manfilt.c to simplify compiling w/o auto-configure
	  "config.h".
	+ modify MS-DOS/Win31/WinNT portion of npopen.c to leave input file
	  descriptor alone when reading from pipe, solving a problem with
	  applications hanging under Thompson Toolkit (patch by Clark O. 
	  Morgan <cmorgan@aracnet.com>)
	+ correct inequality changed in 6.2g which is part of right-margin
	  threshold computation (report and fix by William Yuan
	  <yuan@ariel.ucs.unimelb.edu.au>)
	+ corrected definition of $(exec_prefix) in makefile.in (reported by
	  Joachim Schimpf <J.Schimpf@doc.ic.ac.uk>).
	+ apply suggested casts in vms2unix.c to appease DEC C 5.3 (reported
	  by Andy Harper and Graeme Miller).
