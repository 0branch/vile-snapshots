I've been on this list for a few days now and haven't
seen any traffic.  I guess I'm the only Vile user.
On the off chance that I'm not, I'm posting a perl
hack I recently did that gives you the ability to send edit
requests to a running Vile (sort of like gnuserv does
for Emacs).  Vile is lightweight enough to run several
at a time, but when I'm using a file manager (like TkDesk)
sometimes I like to click on files and "add" them to a
current Vile session.

Attached are two files, Vileserv.pm and vileget.  Vileserv.pm
is for loading into a perl-enabled Vile session, and vileget
is a utility for sending requests to the editor.  You can
use pod2man to get the man pages:

	pod2man Vileserv.pm > vileserv.man
	pod2man vileget > vileget.man

If someone has already written something like this and never told
me about it, color me annoyed. :-)

Enjoy,

	Chris
