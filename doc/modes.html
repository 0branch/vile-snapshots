<h1 id="toplevel-id"><a name="toplevel">Major (and minor) modes in Vile</a></h1>
<p>
This document was originally written in May, 1998, and has been updated
periodically to reflect the proposed implementation of and use of major modes
in vile.
<p>
My goal was to extend the notion of the C mode (cmode)
to allow runtime definable major modes.
<p>
Originally, vile supported a C mode that included a collection of modes
useful for editing C program source:
<ul>
	<li>c-suffixes
	<li>c-tabstop
	<li>c-shiftwidth
</ul><p>
as well as this builtin functionality:
<ul>
	<li>autoindention of C statements taking into account curly braces
	<li>fence matching for /*...*/ comments and C preprocessor statements
	<li>comment formatting
</ul><p>
Both the modes and functionality are extensions of other features in
vile.  It would be useful to combine modes to support other languages
in a similar fashion.  Likewise, the autoindention, etc., could be
parameterized and made reusable to support other languages.  For an
initial implementation, I focused on the combining of modes,
providing a structure for the parameterization.
<p>
One thing that was not clear to many users was the manner in which the C
mode was attached to a buffer.  It was set as a boolean - if active before
a buffer was loaded, then vile checked the file suffix to see if it matched
the c-suffixes mode, and if so, set the C mode for the buffer.  C mode
could also be explicitly set by a ":setl cmode", and unset by ":setl
nocmode".  In the new scheme,
<ul>
	<li>vile searches the list of all active majormodes, first
	  testing if any match with the majormode's suffixes, then if
	  any preamble (first line regular expression) matches.
<p>
	  The search is in normally alphabetic order, by majormode name.
	  The first match each, of suffixes and preamble terminate the
	  search, but a match of suffixes overrides a match of preamble.
	  Use "after" and "before" qualifiers to handle special cases.
<p>
	  In rare circumstances, both suffixes and preamble are needed to
	  distinguish a given mode from another.  Use
<pre>
	  	qualifiers=all
</pre>
	  to specify this.  The default, "qualifiers=any", allows either
	  suffixes or preamble to determine the majormode.
<p>
	  The suffixes and preamble rules can be overridden altogether by
	  specifying $majormode-hook to a script which sets the majormode
	  for the current buffer.

	<li>majormodes can be disabled (e.g., ":set nocmode"), as before.
	  However, there is no global sense of majormode; unsetting a
	  buffer's local value of a majormode simply makes it not have a
	  majormode associated with it.
</ul>

<h2 id="neededcommands-id"><a name="neededcommands">Commands</a></h2>
<p>
These are the commands which I think are necessary:
<ul>
	<li>define-majormode {majormode}

	<li>define-submode {majormode} {minormode}[={value}]

	<li>remove-majormode {majormode}

	<li>remove-submode {majormode} {minormode}

	<li>setl {majormode}

	<li>setl no{majormode}
</ul><p>
The {majormode} is a new symbol.
<p>
The {minormode} can be any one of the existing buffer modes, except for
a {majormode}.  To make name-completion simple, we use the term 'submode'.


<h3 id="example-id"><a name="example">Example</a></h3>
<pre>
	define-majormode c
	; Declares a mode 'c', and corresponding symbol 'cmode'

	define-submode c suffixes=\\.\\(\\([Cchisyl]\\)\\|CC\\|cc|cpp\\|cxx\\|hxx\\|scm\\)$
	; Specifies the filename suffixes which control whether a newly-loaded
	; buffer is set to 'c' mode.

	define-submode c tabstop=4
	define-submode c shiftwidth=4
	; Defines the 'c' tabstop and shiftwidth.  If no "define-submode"
	; command is given, no separate symbol is defined.
</pre><p>
As an example, to define a new major mode for perl programming, you might
include the following in your .vilerc file:
<pre>
	define-majormode perl
	define-submode perl preamble "^#.*perl\\>"
	define-submode perl suffixes '\.\(pm\|t\)$'
	define-submode perl shiftwidth 4
</pre><p>
To avoid the tediousness of this syntax, use the ~with and ~endwidth
keywords, like so:
<pre>
	define-majormode perl
	~with define-submode perl
	    preamble "^#.*perl\\>"
	    suffixes '\.\(pm\|t\)$'
	    shiftwidth 4
	~endwith
</pre><p>
You can define several regions using ~with and (after the first) ~elsewith
blocks.  Each block specifies a set of tokens which are substituted at the
beginning of each line.  Each ~elsewith block should have a group identifier
to distinguish it from the others.  The reason for providing multiple
blocks is to implement complex fence-matching for different language features.
<p>
For example, in the definition of cshmode, the symbols "fence-XXX" give
patterns which vile can use to move the cursor from one if/elif/else/fi
marker to the next as you press "%".  The other settings such as "suf"
in the first block are settings that apply to the majormode itself:
<pre>
	define-mode csh
	~with define-submode csh
	    suf '\.\(csh[^/]*\|login\|logout\)$'
	    pre '^#!\s*\/.*csh\>\(\s*-[a-z]\+\)*\s*$'
	    filtername	'vile-sh-filt -k csh'
	    comment-prefix	'^\s*#'
	    comments	'^\s*#\s*$'
	    fence-if	'^\s*\&lt;if\>.*\&lt;then\>'
	    fence-elif	'^\s*\&lt;else\s*if\>'
	    fence-else	'^\s*\&lt;else\>'
	    fence-fi	'^\s*\&lt;endif\>'
	~elsewith define-submode csh group 'case'
	    fence-if	'^\s*\&lt;switch\>\s*(.*)'
	    fence-elif	'^\s*\&lt;case\>.*:'
	    fence-else	'^\s*\&lt;default\>\s*:'
	    fence-fi	'^\s*\&lt;endsw\>'
	~elsewith define-submode csh group 'loop'
	    fence-if	'^\s*\&lt;foreach\s\+.*\|while\>\s*(.*)'
	    fence-fi	'^\s*\&lt;end\>'
	~endwith
</pre>

<h3 id="definemajormode-id"><a name="definemajormode">The "define-majormode" command</a></h3>
<p>
This takes a single argument, a majormode name.  To follow existing
convention, the string "mode" is automatically appended to the given
name.  Associated modes are defined or modified with the define-submode
command.  Vile maintains a list of majormodes.  Only one majormode can
be associated with a buffer (none need be associated).  After
definition, a majormode can be set or unset just like any other buffer
mode:
<pre>
	define-majormode c
	; defines "cmode"

	setl cmode
	; sets the mode for the current buffer

	setl nocmode
	; clear c mode (existing implementation)

	unsetl cmode
	; clear c mode
</pre><p>
The restriction to a single majormode is because mode values are
internally represented as structures with a pointer.  The pointer
denotes which value (currently local or global) is used.  The
majormode implementation adds a level to this, e.g.,
<pre>
	value -> self (local)
	value -> global (global)
	value -> major (majormode)
</pre><p>
When a majormode is defined, an array of the existing minor mode values
is allocated, all pointing to the global modes.  The define-submode
command modifies these to make them local pointers.  When a buffer is
associated with a majormode, all of its buffer mode values are pointed
to the majormode's values.  (To keep the bookkeeping straight, modifying
a global buffer mode must also modify the copies of non-local buffer
mode values).

<h3 id="definesubmode-id"><a name="definesubmode">The "define-submode" command</a></h3>
<p>
This command sets local values of buffer modes for the given majormode,
e.g.,
<pre>
	define-submode c autoindent
</pre><p>
The majormode name is required.  The names after the majormode name are
names of buffer modes with a corresponding value.  Any number of modes
can be specified in a single command, e.g.,
<pre>
	define-submode c autoindent tabstop=4
</pre><p>
For each mode given, vile defines corresponding names by which they can
be referenced, e.g., "c-autoindent" (from the long mode name
"autoindent") and "cai" (from the short mode name "ai" for autoindent). 
The long mode name is always appended with a hyphen, and the short mode
name is appended without a hyphen.
<p>
The term "submode" is used in the command rather than the more natural
"minor mode" to simplify name-completion.
<p>
The following are keywords that aren't minor modes, but are recognized
solely by the define-submode command:
<dl>
<dt>mode-pathname<dd>
		The full pathname which is tested to trigger association with a
		majormode, e.g., "RCS/*,v".

<dt>mode-filename<dd>
		The filename which is tested to trigger association with a
		majormode, e.g., "Makefile".

<dt>suffixes<dd>
		The filename suffix which is tested to trigger
		association with a majormode (e.g., c-suffixes)

		Note that since the default value for the c-suffixes mode
		is a regular expression that will match some other file
		types (C++ files, for instance), if you define a new major
		mode for one of those suffixes you may want to reset
		c-suffixes to something less inclusive.

<dt>preamble<dd>
		Regular expression, matched against the beginning of a
		file (the first line) used to trigger association with
		a majormode (e.g., "^!#.*\/perl[^a-z]").

<dt>filtername<dd>
		A shell command telling which filter to call, and how to do
		that.  The form of the command is limited, since it is
		interpreted for internal calls:
<pre>
			{filter} {options}
</pre><p>
		where {filter} is the filename for the filter, e.g.,
<pre>
			vile-c-filt
</pre><p>
		and options include:
<dl>
<dt>-k mode<dd>
				The keyword filename, omitting ".keywords".
				For instance, the C filter vile-c-filt is used
				for C, C++, JavaScript and Java by changing the
				keyword file.
<dt>-q<dd>
				Quit after loading the keyword definitions.
<dt>-t tabs<dd>
				Set the tabstops, used in the imake filter
				to check for coincidental matches between a
				tab and spaces that are the same number of
				columns.
<dt>-v
<dt>-vv<dd>
				Debug traces, mainly to show which keyword
				files are loaded, and what information is
				parsed from them.
</dl><p>
		Other options may be implemented that are specific to a filter
		program.  For instance, vile-c-filt recognizes a -p option to
		mark preprocessor lines with an error (used for Java).

<dt>before
<dt>after<dd>
		A string that tells vile how to rank the majormode.
		Normally vile checks each mode in order by name, but there
		are special cases where you may want to check one mode
		before another.  For example, the C++ majormode cppmode
		would be checked after cmode, but that uses suffixes which
		are a subset of the built-in cmode's suffixes and would not
		be found.  So cppmode is qualified before="c".

<dt>group<dd>
		followed by a name, defines an alternative set of submode
		values.
<p>
		Currently used only for complex fences, this could be applied
		to simple fences, and (with new flags not yet defined) extend
		both styles of fences for indentation and formatting.

<dt>fences<dd>
		These are "complex" fences, which are matched one expression
		per line.  The names are "fence-" followed by any of the
		following keywords with a regular expression:
<pre>
			if, elif, else, fi
</pre><p>
		Vile searches through all groups of complex fences for a
		match before trying simple fences.

<dt>comments<dd>
		These are "simple" fences, which can be matched any number
		of times per line.  The pairs need not appear on the same
		line.  Like complex fences, they have an implied order.
		The default values support C-style comments, with the '%' going
		between "/*" and "*/".  The names use "fence-" followed any of
		the following keywords with a regular expression:  begin, end.

<dt>indent	(not implemented)<dd>
		The keyword "cstyle", or any of the following keywords
		with a regular expression: begin, end, if, then, else,
		elif, endif.
</dl><p>
Other features which should be controlled by majormodes include limiting
the scope of the entab and detab commands.


<h3 id="removemajormode-id"><a name="removemajormode">The "remove-majormode" command</a></h3>
<p>
This command has two forms:
<dl>
<dt>remove-majormode {majormode}<dd>
		This removes the definition of the majormode.  Buffers
		that were associated with the mode revert to no
		majormode.
</dl><p>
or
<dl>
<dt>remove-majormode {majormode} {name}<dd>
		This removes the value of {name} from {majormode},
		leaving it set to the global value, if any.
</dl>

<h3 id="removesubmode-id"><a name="removesubmode">The "remove-submode" command</a></h3>
<p>
Remove the special association of a submode from a majormode.

<h3 id="example2-id"><a name="example2">Example</a></h3>
<p>
The original builtin C/C++ majormode description is equivalent to
<pre>
	define-mode c
	~with define-submode c
		suffix "\\.\\(\\([Cchisyl]\\)\\|CC\\|cc|cpp\\|cxx\\|hxx\\|scm\\)$"
		comment-prefix="^\\s*\\(\\s*[#*>]\\)\\+"
		comments="^\\s*/\\?\\(\\s*[#*>]\\)\\+/\\?\\s*$"
		fence-begin="/\\*"
		fence-end="\\*/"
		fence-if="^\\s*#\\s*if"
		fence-elif="^\\s*#\\s*elif\\>"
		fence-else="^\\s*#\\s*else\\>"
		fence-fi="^\\s*#\\s*endif\\>"
		cindent
	~endwith
</pre><p>
Note that the following are equivalent once you have defined the majormode "c":
<pre>
	set cts=8
	set c-tabstop=8
	define-submode c tabstop=8
</pre>
