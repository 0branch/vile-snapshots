Subject: directory browser

Here is a directory browser extension for vile written with the perl interface.

The main features of the directory browser are:

1. two panel display for separate listing of directories and files
2. configurable color hilighting based on the type of the file
3. recognizes broken symlinks
4. hypertext based directory traversal and file viewing
5. mime aware capabilities to view files using appropriate applications
6. plugins extension to the mime library to allow to view certain files
   within vile after passing through a vile based perl filter routine.

The package contains the following three perl files.

1. directory.pl
2. mime.pl
3. plugins.pl

Detailed pod documentation is contained within each file.

The package also contains sample files for:

1. ~/.vile/mailcap
2. ~/.vile/mime.types

To get started off without reading the documentation:

1. put all the three perl files in ~/.vile/perl

2. put the sample mailcap and mime.types files in ~/.vile

3. put the following lines in your .vilerc

        22 store-macro
            ~force execute-hypertext-command
            ~if &not $status
                ~force forward-character-to-eol
            ~endif
        ~endm
        bind-key execute-macro-22 ^M
	perl "use directory"

4. open up vile and type

	:directory<RET>

5. Press <RETURN> on directory name to change to that directory and on the file
   name to view that file.

Finally, i have included a gif image to give an idea of what the directory
browser looks like within xvile.

Suggestions, critisism, questions welcome.

Special thanks to Kevin for clearing up (couple of?) bugs that I ran into when
I started off on this.
