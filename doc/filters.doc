FILTERS.DOC
-----------

There are several highlighting filters in the filters subdirectory.  These all
are programs that read a file, usually from the standard input, and write to
the standard output.  Vile invokes these, uses the marked-up text to display
highlighting.

Except for the manpage filter (a special case) all of these can be (and most
are) implemented using lex.

KEYWORDS
--------

Each filter reads one or more keyword files, which list specific keywords
and their highlighting attributes, as well as classes of keywords.

The filters search for these files in the current, $HOME, $HOME/vile and
startup directories.  On Unix, the keyword files are hidden using a "." prefix. 
Except for MS-DOS, the suffix is ".keywords"; on that platform it is ".key". 
You can specify the root name to search, otherwise they search for "vile" and
the filter name, e.g., "c".

Defined keyword classes include (but may not be used in specific filters):

	Action
	Comment
	Ident
	Keyword
	Literal
	Number
	Preproc
	Type

Each line in the keyword file consists of two strings separated by a colon (:).
If the first string is empty, the line is treated as a comment.  The second
string is used as the highlighting attributes for the first string.  An
empty attribute string implies "Keyword".

Tell how the new filters search along ., $HOME, $HOME/vile and startup path.
You can override the behavior, but otherwise they search for both "vile"
and the specific language keywords, if any.

PROGRAMS
--------

The following are implemented:

	vile-c-filt	(C language)
	vile-cweb-filt	(CWEBx)
	vile-html-filt	(HTML)
	vile-latex-filt	(LaTeX or TeX)
	vile-lex-filt	(lex)
	vile-make-filt	(make)
	vile-manfilt	(manpage)
	vile-pas-filt	(Pascal)
	vile-perl-filt	(Perl)
	vile-sh-filt	(sh/ksh/csh)
	vile-vile-filt	(Vile's macros)

BUGS (1998/12/21)
----

Not all filters use a keywords file (yet).

The filters make inconsistent use of implicit linking in the keywords file,
e.g.,
	Keyword:B
	if:Keyword

is the design, which is not always implemented (yet).

No check is made to exclude identifiers with leading capitals from the
highlighting.

The lex filters have been tested only with flex, which treats newlines
differently.  Older versions of lex also do not support the %x states.
