FILTERS.DOC
-----------

There are several highlighting filters in the filters subdirectory.  These all
are programs that read a file, usually from the standard input, and write to
the standard output.  Vile invokes these, uses the marked-up text to display
highlighting.

Except for the manpage filter (a special case) all of these can be (and most
are) implemented using lex.

KEYWORDS
--------

Each filter reads one or more keyword files, which list specific keywords
and their highlighting attributes, as well as classes of keywords.

The filters search for these files in the current, $HOME, $HOME/vile and
startup directories.  On Unix, the keyword files are hidden using a "." prefix. 
Except for MS-DOS, the suffix is ".keywords"; on that platform it is ".key". 
You can specify the root name to search, otherwise they search for "vile" and
the filter name, e.g., "c".

Predefined keyword classes include (but may not necessarily be used in specific
filters):

	Action
	Comment
	Ident
	Ident2
	Keyword
	Keyword2
	Literal
	Number
	Preproc
	Type

Each line in the keyword file consists of two strings separated by a colon (:).
If the first string is empty, the line is treated as a comment.  The second
string is used as the highlighting attributes for the first string.  An
empty attribute string implies "Keyword".  If the second string matches
a keyword class (or in fact, any other keyword), the highlighting attributes
of that keyword are used.

The keyword file reader supports a limited include facility.  If a line begins
with ".include", it reads from the given keyword file.  A few filters (such as
html) require multiple symbol tables; these include using ".merge".  In either
case, the parameter of the include is the root name of the keyword file, e.g.,
"c" for "c.key".

You can change the characters assigned to ':' and '.' using ".equals" and
".meta" directives, respectively.

You can modify the behavior slightly, by giving an absolute pathname with
the -k option, but otherwise they search for both "vile" and the specific
language keywords, if any.

BUGS (1999/3/8)
----

Not all filters use a keywords file (yet).

The lex filters have been well tested only with flex, which treats newlines
differently.  Older versions of lex may not support the %x states.
