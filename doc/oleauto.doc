                           OLE Automation Support
                           ======================
Winvile can be built and configured to execute as an OLE Automation server.
The following steps are required:

   1) build a version of winvile that supports OLE,
   2) configure winvile as a server, and
   3) use an OLE automation client to invoke and manipulate winvile.


Build Syntax
============
By default, winvile is _not_ built with OLE Automation enabled, but this
command adds that feature:

    nmake -f makefile.wnt CFG=winvile OPT=ole-auto

Or, if an embedded perl support is desired, use this syntax:

    nmake -f makefile.wnt CFG=winvile-with-perl OPT=ole-auto


Minimal Configuration
=====================
OLE Automation support is not available until the Windows registry has been
updated with various configuration information.  The simplest method of
registration is to:

    a) copy winvile.exe to some directory in your PATH, and then
    b) execute this command:

            winvile -Or

Step b) registers winvile as an OLE automation server that will be launched
(by a client) with _no_ command line options, which implies these server
attributes:

    - editor geometry is 24 rows by 80 columns
    - editor visible
    - a single server instance (i.e., no matter how many clients create a
      winvile server object, there will be at most one server instance).

There are, however, a number of command line options that can be specified
during registration and which subsequently affect the launched winvile
server.


Registration Options
====================
The complete registration syntax is:

    winvile -Or [-geometry <rows>x<cols>] [-multiple] [-invisible]

where:

    -geometry <rows>x<cols>   specifies the editor's window geometry.
    -invisible                launched server(s) are invisible and must be
                                  made visible via the application's Visible
                                  property.
    -multiple                 each client creates a new, unique server
                                  instance.


Example Automation Client Access
================================
Perl Access
    use Win32::OLE;
    $vile = new Win32::OLE 'Winvile.Application';
    $vile->VileKeys(":show-bindings\n");
    $vile->{Visible} = 1;           # may not be necessary
    print "sleeping for 3 seconds\n";
    sleep(3);
    $vile->VileKeys(":buffer [unnamed]\n");
    $vile->VileKeys(":r c:/config.sys\n");
    sleep(3);
    print "killing vile\n";
    $vile->Quit();
    exit

VB Access
    Private VileObj As Winvile.Application

    Private Sub Form_Load()
    Set VileObj = New Winvile.Application
    VileObj.Visible = True           ' may not be necessary
    VileObj.VileKeys (":help" + vbLf)
    End Sub

    Private Sub Quit_Click()
    VileObj.Quit                     ' Kill the server (winvile)
    End
    End Sub


Server Properties And Methods
=============================
Application         -- [out] Returns the application object.

ForegroundWindow()  -- Makes the editor the foreground window.  Note that NT5
                       has redefined the behavior of SetForegroundWindow().

FullName            -- [out] Returns the path of the application.

InsertMode          -- [out] True if editor window with keyboard focus is
                       in insert mode.

IsMinimized         -- [out] True if editor minimized.

Minimize()          -- Minimizes the editor.

Name()              -- [out] Returns the name of the application.

Parent()            -- Returns the parent of the application object.

Quit()              -- Exits the editor.

Restore()           -- Restores the editor's window.

VileKeys([in] keys) -- Sends keystrokes to the editor.  Note that this method
                       is implemented by using PostMessage() to send a
                       WM_CHAR message for _each_ character in the "keys"
                       string.  In other words, this is not an efficient
                       method and should not be used to create large files.

Visible             -- [in, out] Sets or returns the editor's visibility.

Note:  ForegroundWindow(), Minimize(), and Restore() implicitly force an
       Invisible server to the Visible state.


Unregistering The Server
========================
To unregister winvile as an OLE automation server, execute this command:

    winvile -Ou
